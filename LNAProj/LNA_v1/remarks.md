Designed for S11, Zin and Gain

Ibias = 2.8mA, W = 116um, Ls = 414pH, Lg = 20nH, Rd = 591 ohm

Trade off: For better S11 characteristics, cemtre frequency must be shifted towards 1.9GHz, but for better Gain BW centre freq should be shifted away from 1.9GHz.
(Desired centre freq = 2GHz)

Current SotA: 
* for Ld = 3.2nH, S11 spec is met exactly, Gain has 3dB BW of 132.26 MHz, centre freq = 1.936GHz
    
* for Ld = 3.1 nH, S11 < -10 dB for 1.92GHz < f < 2.1 GHz; Gain centre frequency = 1.96 GHz 


Pending: NF analysis, parasitic resistance to be added to inductors, IIP3 analysis and report..
